# The-Image-Cartonifier


[In the first week, we started with the programming language PYTHON and some libraries associated with it Numpy and Panda for which we are given a week which includes an assignment to submit.
In the second week, they give us a bunch of videos to learn machine learning and again then we get assignments for the same. 
In this week going on I had completed just Neural Networks and Deep Learning as this week includes two weeks of resources. ]
